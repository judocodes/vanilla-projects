## What am I doing here?

I'm just trying to broaden my coding repertoire by doing small projects every day. I also found that it's very fun to work on small, lightweight projects inbetween working on bigger ones for which you have to read lots of documentation.

So, everyday I'm coding, I'll upload one or two of those little Vanilla JS projects.

I also want to practice OOP and working with CSS grid, so wherever I can, I'll try to implement these coding patterns.

## How to view?

There are no dependencies for these projects (except for a modern browser), so you can simply download the directories and view the index.html files. Have fun!

## What are these projects?
Basically, I've stolen inspiration from other people and try to implement those little ideas with my own code. They are from different courses, online challenges, or repositories of friends. You learn by imitating :)
